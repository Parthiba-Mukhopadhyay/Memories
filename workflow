Tech stacks- Typescript, vite.js, shadcn-ui, tailwind CSS, appwrite

initialize vite with react
move assets and restart src
make main.tsx, app.tsx, globals.css (to apply to whole project)
make routes in app for public and private routes
create public and private sections separately under auth and root
to use shadcn ui, follow installation manual, update tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts.
this results in creation of components and lib folders, any ui component you draw from shadcn gets stored here
now install appwrite
setup appwrite for storage, database and enter the keys in .env file
setup database following figma schema
